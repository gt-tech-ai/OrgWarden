# üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è OrgWarden (Work In Progress)

*OrgWarden* helps ensure your GitHub organization's repositories follow best practices. Under the hood, OrgWarden uses [RepoAuditor](https://github.com/gt-sse-center/RepoAuditor).

## Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gt-tech-ai/OrgWarden.git

cd OrgWarden
```

#### 2. Sync Project with `uv`
```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage
You can run the tool with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). The available commands are as follows:

### List Repositories
Lists all public, non-forked repositories for the specified GitHub organization.
```bash
uv run orgwarden list-repos <org_url>
```

### Audit
Runs [RepoAuditor](https://github.com/gt-sse-center/RepoAuditor) tooling. If the provided url points to a GitHub repository, RepoAuditor will run against said repository. If the provided url points to a GitHub organization, RepoAuditor will run against all public, non-forked repositories within said organization. The `gh-pat` option is a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that RepoAuditor requires for full funcionality.

*Due to an issue with the GitHub API, OrgWarden currently only supports Classic PATs.*
```bash
uv run orgwarden audit <repo_or_org_url> --gh-pat [token]
```

## Using OrgWarden in GitHub Actions
OrgWarden runs daily via the [Auto-Audit](.github/workflows/Auto_Audit.yml) workflow. The run will fail if any of your organization's public, non-forked repositories fail an audit. Information on specific audit errors can be found in the failed workflow's [logs](../../../actions/workflows/Auto_Audit.yml). The workflow runs regardless of whether a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) has been setup, but will always fail if the token is not provided.

To setup a PAT for use in the workflow, please add your token as a [GitHub Actions Secret](../../../settings/secrets/actions) with the *Name* `AUTO_AUDIT_PAT`. Due to an issue with the GitHub API, your PAT must be a *Classic* token. *Fine-Grained* tokens are currently not supported. Your PAT must have the following minimum permissions:
